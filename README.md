# Python NLP Data Processing

# This project replicates a basic version of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that takes user input, usually a question, commonly asked to a Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, Cortana, etc., to understand what the user is asking and possibly perform an appropriate action. This is a developing project that is going to be built modularly.
